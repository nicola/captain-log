## Quick history

I learned the practice of writing a captain.log from [@daviddias](https://github.com/diasdavid/) in his work on `js-ipfs` (see his [really cool log](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/30)). When I started my [captain.log](https://github.com/ipld/specs/issues/13) I found really useful to list all the different issues that are open, closed, that need a spec that had something happening & so on. This process is very slow for humans but fast for machines :)
